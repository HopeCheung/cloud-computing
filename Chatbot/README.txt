When user input contains "Hi", "hi", "Hello" or "hello", the chat bot replies "Hi, nice to meet you!"

When user input contains "movies", "music", "fantasy", "games" or "video", the chat bot replies "Yeah, we need some fun in life."

When user input contains "sad", "happy" or "love", the chat bot replies "I think I know how it feels...though you may not believe me:)"

When user input contains "exam", "homework" or "midterm", the chat bot replies "That's awful!"

When none of the mentioned words is included in the input, the chat bot replies with a random sentence in five pre-defined sentences.
